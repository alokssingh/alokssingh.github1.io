Hi!

Currently, I am working with [Sustainable Finance Group](https://www.cgfi.ac.uk/2023/03/alok-singh/) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) as a Research Associate in Machine Learning.

I received my PhD from [National Institute of Technology silchar](http://http://www.nits.ac.in/) Assam, India. My research interests lie in the areas of multimodal machine learning, automatic video captioning, shot boundary detection and natural language processing. I am fortunate to be advised by [ Dr. Thoudam Doren Singh](http://cs.nits.ac.in/doren/) and [Prof. Sivaji Bandyopadhyay](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/profile.php?uid=2).

Before starting my PhD, I received my master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from NIT Silchar, India in 2019. During my master's, I invested my valuable time by working on Shot Boundary Detection under the supervision of [Dr Dalton Meitei Thounaojam](http://cs.nits.ac.in/dalton/).
