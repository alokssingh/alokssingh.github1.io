Hi!

I am a PhD student at the [National Institute of Technology silchar](http://http://www.nits.ac.in/). My research interests lie in the areas of multimodal machine learning, automatic video captioning, shot boundary detection and natural language processing. I am fortunate to be advised by [ Dr. Thoudam Doren Singh](http://cs.nits.ac.in/doren/) and [Prof. Sivaji Bandyopadhyay](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/profile.php?uid=2).

Prior to starting my PhD, I received my master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from NIT silchar, India in 2019. During my master's, I invested my valuable time by working on Shot Boundary Detection under the supervison of [Dr Dalton Meitei Thounaojam](http://cs.nits.ac.in/dalton/).
