I am interested in enabling machines to learn from multiple modalities of data like text, audio, video, semantics as humans naturally do.

### Ongoing Research

* **Video to text generaton**  
Building robust system that will able to generate a short description of actions and events of the video.
  

### During Masters
* **Shot boundary detection for temporal segmentation of the video**  
Advised by [Dr Dalton Meitei Thounaojam](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=MoD6g-UAAAAJ&hl=en) 

### Datasets
